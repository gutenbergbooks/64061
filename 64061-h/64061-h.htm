THE GAME OF BATTLE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The Game of Battle represents two antagonistic armies,
one of which, the Attacking (or Invading) Army,
is composed of four figures, each representing a regiment
of Light Infantry; five figures, each representing
a regiment of Infantry of the Line; two figures, each
representing a regiment of Cavalry; two figures, each
representing a battery of Artillery; and one figure (a
wagon), representing the &#8220;Supply Train,&#8221; in which it is
to be supposed is carried all of the subsistence, ordnance
stores, etc., necessary for the maintenance and effectiveness
of the army.</p>

<p>The object of the Attacking Army will be to capture
the Citadel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>The other army, called the Defending Army, is composed
of four figures, each representing a regiment of
Light Infantry; five figures, each representing a regiment
of Infantry of the Line; two figures, each representing
a regiment of Cavalry; two figures, each representing
a battery of Artillery; and one figure, the Citadel,
representing a city in which are arms, ammunition,
foundries, subsistence supplies, and all kinds of government
property, which it is of vital importance to hold.</p>

<p>The object, therefore, of the Defending Army will be
to secure the Citadel against capture.</p>

<span class="tiny">OF</span><br />
THE GAME OF BATTLE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Light Infantry moves one, two, or three squares, at
the discretion of the player, directly forward, right or
left obliquely, and one or two squares in any other direction,
and can<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> take Light Infantry, Infantry of the
Line, Cavalry, and Artillery.</p>

<p>Infantry of the Line moves one or two squares in any
direction, at the discretion of the player, and takes
Light Infantry, Infantry of the Line, Cavalry, and Artillery.</p>

<p>Cavalry moves one, two, or three squares, at the discretion
of the player, in any direction, and takes Light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Infantry, Infantry of the Line, Cavalry, and Artillery.</p>

<p>Artillery moves one, two, or three squares, at the
discretion of the player, diagonally, and can<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> take Artillery,
but cannot take Light Infantry, Infantry of the
Line, or Cavalry, though it can check them; that is,
neither of those figures can come within the range of
the Artillery, except when protected by Artillery of its
side; in which case Light Infantry, Infantry of the
Line, Cavalry, or Artillery, can move on the first square
next to the Artillery of their side; but Light Infantry,
Infantry of the Line, or Cavalry, cannot occupy the
second or third square; nor can either of the last-named
figures occupy the first square next to the Artillery
of their side, if it is also the first square next to the
Artillery of the other side. Artillery can be placed
there, but of course could be taken by the Artillery of
the other side. See Plate 2, Figure 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>Artillery does not cover (or command) the second or
third square from it when a figure intervenes. See
Plate 2, Figure 2.</p>

<p>When a piece of artillery bears on a figure of the
other side that is not on the first square next to the Artillery
of its side, if Cavalry, Light Infantry, or Infantry
of the Line, it must move out of range of Artillery.
See Plate 2, Figure 3.</p>

<p>Artillery cannot be moved leaving a figure of Cavalry,
Light Infantry, or Infantry of the Line, of its side,
in range of Artillery of the opposite side. See Plate 2,
Figure 4.</p>

<p>Artillery cannot take the Citadel; but when placed
so as to command it, the defending party must bring
some figure to the defence, and take or drive off the
Artillery of the attacking party before moving otherwise.</p>

<p>Artillery cannot take the Wagon; but when a piece
of Artillery of the defending side is placed so as to bring
the Wagon within its range, if the attacking party cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
take that piece of Artillery, then the Wagon must
be moved out of its range.</p>

<p>The Wagon cannot occupy the second or third square
from its Artillery, if that square is in range of the Artillery
of the defending side; nor can it occupy the first
square next to the Artillery of its side, if it is also the
first square next to the Artillery of the defending side.</p>

<p>Should all of the figures of a side be taken except the
Artillery, that side loses the game, as Artillery cannot
take the Citadel or Wagon.</p>

<p>Light Infantry, Infantry of the Line, or Cavalry, can
take the Citadel or Wagon.</p>

<p>The capture of the Citadel or Wagon will decide the
game.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">REMARKS</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">ILLUSTRATING THE POWER OF THE FIGURES IN THE<br />
GAME, AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF TROOPS IN THE<br />
FIELD.</p>


<p>The inventor has endeavored to give to the figures of
his game a relative power which would, as nearly as
practicable, accord with that of the arms represented.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the Infantry of the Line
moves one or two squares in any direction, and can
take either Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery; while the
Cavalry can move one, two, or three squares, in any
direction, and can take either Cavalry, Infantry, or Artillery.
We know that in a country comparatively
level, such as the board represents, and presenting no
obstacle except the river, Infantry or Cavalry can move
in any direction, and under some circumstances either
of those arms is good against the other. It is, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
course, necessary that there should be some distinction
in the moves of the different figures; and as Cavalry
can move more rapidly than Infantry, it has power to
move three squares, while the Infantry of the Line
moves but two.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said by some that the Cavalry has
the advantage of the Infantry; but on placing a piece
of Cavalry and a piece of Infantry on the board, by cautious
playing, it will be found almost impossible to capture
the Infantry with the single piece of Cavalry.</p>

<p>In the field, a regiment of Infantry, attacked by a
regiment of Cavalry, might easily escape altogether, or
may repulse and capture the regiment of Cavalry. The
reverse may happen, and the Cavalry, well handled,
may defeat and capture the regiment of Infantry.</p>

<p>The Light Infantry moves one, two, or three squares,
directly forward, right or left obliquely, and one or two
squares in any other direction. The object of this is,
chiefly, that there shall be a distinguishing power between
it and the Infantry of the Line.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>Light Infantry in the field does, or should, have the
advantage in moving more rapidly; besides, it often has
arms of a longer range, and can be used more successfully
when a sudden and rapid movement is necessary.</p>

<p>The Artillery moves diagonally, and has a range of
three squares on the diagonals. It cannot move perpendicularly
or laterally, therefore has no power in
those directions.</p>

<p>The Artillery can attain any position on the board,
but cannot always reach it directly, as does the Infantry
and Cavalry, but, in many instances, must make a
detour to the right or left.</p>

<p>This distinguishing move is proper, inasmuch as a
carriage cannot always follow the course of a man or
horse, yet it may reach any point that they can in a
country such as is represented by the board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Infantry or Cavalry cannot move in range of Artillery
of the opposing side, except when protected by Artillery
of their side,&#8221; etc. Artillery in the field may occupy
a position, several approaches to which it may so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
thoroughly command that it would be impracticable for
Infantry or Cavalry to take it, unassisted by Artillery,
by either of those approaches. Artillery would have to
be brought up in order to operate on the first-named
Artillery, or some other line of attack must be sought.</p>

<p>In the game, when one piece of Artillery <i>is not</i> protected
by another, there are four other points at which
it may be assailed, namely, the angles of the square.
But when one piece of Artillery is supported by another,
neither can be taken by Cavalry or Infantry without
the aid of their Artillery.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>If a battery in the field occupied a position commanding
thoroughly all of the approaches to it, and another
battery of the same side was placed a short distance behind
it, say in easy range, and commanded the first battery,
it would be very difficult for Cavalry or Infantry
to take the first-mentioned battery; and if they succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
in taking it, they could not easily, if at all, hold
it while under the fire of the supporting battery.</p>

<p>It may appear that the Artillery in the game has too
much power; but it must be remembered that a piece
of Artillery of one side can always take a piece of Artillery
of the other side that is placed in its range.</p>

<p>It often occurs in the field that one battery is brought
up close under the fire of another, to dislodge it; and if
both are well served, one must soon give way. See
Plate 4, Figure 1.</p>

<p>The Wagon,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> representing the Supply Train, moves
diagonally, like the Artillery, but only one or two
squares at a time; for it should not move so rapidly,
therefore it does not move so far.</p>

<p>The player should be careful to guard the Wagon,
for if it is captured he loses the game.</p>

<p>An invading army entering a country where supplies
cannot be procured, must necessarily carry them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
him; and should his train be captured, with a good
army in his front, he would be in great danger of destruction.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">SUGGESTIONS TO PLAYERS.</h2>
</div>


<p>The attacking party should first determine upon a
plan of attack. Then proceed to arrange his figures in
proper order for the accomplishment of his plan. He
should guard his lines, by throwing forward Light Infantry
and Cavalry; but will endeavor to avoid an engagement
until his order of attack is formed.</p>

<p>Unless to secure a very decided advantage, when
once put in operation his first plan should not be abandoned.
The time lost in arranging a new plan may
be taken advantage of by the defending party, who
might assume the offensive and win the game.</p>

<p>The defending party, at the opening of the game,
should throw forward Light Infantry and Cavalry, to
guard against any rapid movement to take the Citadel,
that may be attempted by the attacking party with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Cavalry and Light Infantry. This will also give him
time and space for moving up and arranging his figures
in proper order for defence.</p>

<p>In advancing the Cavalry and Light Infantry, great
caution should be observed in placing the figures on the
squares most desirable for checking the advance of the
attacking party, while at the same time they are not
endangered.</p>

<p>No figure should be lost, if it can be avoided, at this
stage of the game; and no figure of the attacking party,
except Artillery, should be taken at the risk of the loss
of one of the defending party. Indeed, the defending
side should continue to remain strictly on the defence
till a good opportunity is offered for an attack; as, for instance,
when the figures of the attacking party are scattered,
and not in supporting distance of each other.</p>

<p>It is, however, best not to cross the river until the
attacking side is weakened by a considerable loss.</p>

<p>Early in the game, an opportunity is seldom offered
by a good player, where it is safe for the defending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
party to cross the river with a single figure; and it is
only when the attacking party has been weakened by
the loss of three or four figures, that two or three figures
can be spared from the defence.</p>

<p>When such advance is determined upon, be always
careful to leave the Citadel as securely guarded as possible.</p>

<p>If the attacking party be an expert player, he will
avoid an engagement until he has arranged his figures
in order for a grand attack.</p>

<p>If it is discovered that he is thus engaged, every good
opportunity to annoy him, and prevent the formation
of his plan, should be taken advantage of by man&#339;uvres,
feints, and sometimes real attacks, particularly at
his Artillery: and his Artillery should be taken, if possible,
even if it involve the loss of one or two figures of
the defending party; for by the loss of one piece of his
Artillery he will be more crippled than by the loss of
almost any two other figures.</p>

<p>The game requires the constant attention of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
players. Often the slightest mistake leads to defeat;
therefore be careful that every move is for a purpose.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p class="caption">PLATE 1.</p></div>


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Explanation to Plate 1.</h2>
</div>


<p>The board has one hundred and thirty-nine (139) squares that can be occupied.
It represents a comparatively level field, traversed by a river impassable
except at the fords and bridge.</p>

<p>In crossing the fords and bridge the figures move one, two, or three squares,
according to their power, as elsewhere on the board. The short black lines indicate
the entrances to the fords and bridge.</p>

<p>A figure cannot take, or check, another across the river, except at the fords
and bridge. For example, a figure on square 39 cannot take, or check, a figure
on square 54; nor can a figure on square 55 take, or check, a figure on square
40 or 48. (Squares are numbered in Plate 4.)</p>


<p class="center">ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIGURES ON COMMENCING THE GAME.</p>

<p>On the defending side, Cavalry occupies the first square on the right of the
line of nine squares. Artillery, the second. Infantry of the Line, third, fourth,
and fifth. Cavalry, sixth. Artillery, seventh. Infantry of the Line, eighth
and ninth. The Citadel, fifth square from the right of the first line of eight
squares. Light Infantry, first, third, fifth, and seventh squares of the second
row of seven squares.</p>

<p>The figures of the attacking side are arranged like those of the defence, except
that the Wagon is placed on the fifth square of the line of nine squares,
and a piece of Infantry of the Line on the first square immediately in front
of it.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Explanation to Plate 2.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;When two pieces of Artillery, of opposite sides, are thus placed,
no figure, except Artillery, can occupy the squares one or two. If Artillery is
placed on either square, it can be taken by the Artillery of the other side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;The figure on square nine cannot now move on square seven, because
&#8220;a figure cannot occupy the second or third square from its Artillery, if
that square is in range of the Artillery of the other side.&#8221; But if the figure on
square eight moves to square six, then the figure on square nine could occupy
square seven, for that square will not then be covered by the Artillery on
square five.</p>

<p>Should the figure on square eight be placed on square four, then the Artillery
on squares three and five do not protect each other; and in that case the
Cavalry on square ten could take either of them: or the figure on square nine
could take the Artillery on square five, and if it were taken by the figure that
was on square eight, now on square four, then the Artillery on square three
could be taken by the Cavalry on square ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;In this case, if the Artillery on square fourteen is moved to
square fifteen, then the figures on squares sixteen and seventeen would be in
range of that piece, and must move (one at a time, of course); or after one is
moved, the Artillery on square eighteen may be brought up on the next square
to the remaining figure. For example, if the figure on square sixteen be
moved out of range, then the Artillery on square eighteen could be moved to
square nineteen, to the support of the figure on square seventeen. If either of
the squares sixteen or seventeen should be occupied by Artillery, of course that
figure could take the Artillery moved to square fifteen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;White figures representing the attacking party, and the black
figures the defending party.</p>

<p>The attacking party having the move, suppose the figure of Cavalry on
square twenty is moved to square twenty-one or twenty-two, then the Artillery
on square twenty-five is in danger of capture when the attacking party has another
move. Now the Artillery on square twenty-five cannot move, leaving
the figure on square twenty-four in range of the Artillery on square twenty-three.
If the player desires to save his Artillery on square twenty-five, he
might move the figure or square twenty-four to square twenty-six, in order to
protect his Artillery from capture by the Cavalry moved to twenty-one or
twenty-two; and if that piece were taken by the Cavalry, he would then have
an opportunity to move his Artillery away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;Shows how the Wagon may be taken.</p>

<p>Suppose the attacking party, having been repulsed with considerable loss, is
driven back from the river, pursued by the defending party, and the figures of
the two sides occupy the squares indicated in this plate&mdash;the white figures
representing the invading army, and the black figures the defending army.</p>

<p>The defending party having the move, suppose the Artillery on square fourteen
is moved to square thirteen. Then the Cavalry on square eight must
move, as &#8220;no figure, except Artillery, can occupy the first square next to the
Artillery of its side, if it is also the first square next to the Artillery of the
other side.&#8221; If the Cavalry on square eight is moved to square four, then the
Artillery now on square thirteen can take the Artillery on square five, and
could be taken by the Cavalry moved to square four, or the Infantry on square
six, or the Artillery on square two. Suppose it (the Artillery of defending side
having taken the Artillery on square five) is taken by the Cavalry now occupying
square four; then the Cavalry on square eleven could take the Artillery on
square two, and if it (the Cavalry of defending side, moved to square two) is
taken by the Cavalry of attacking party now on square five, or the Infantry on
square six, then the Infantry of defending party, on square seven, could take
the Wagon on square one.</p>

<p>There are many other combinations for the capture of the Wagon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Shows how the Citadel may be taken.</p>

<p>Light Infantry, Infantry of the Line, or Cavalry of the attacking side, can
take the Citadel when it is within their range, if no figure intervenes. For example,
if the Artillery of the defending side is placed as indicated in this
figure (on squares eight and ten), a figure of Cavalry or Light Infantry of the
attacking party, on square one, or a figure of Cavalry, Infantry of the Line, or
Light Infantry, being on square two, three, four, six, or seven, or a figure of
Cavalry on square five, could take the Citadel, if the attacking side had the
move. But suppose the defending party had the move, and a figure of Cavalry
or Infantry occupied square one or two, and either piece of Artillery was
placed on square nine; then the figure on square one or two could not take the
Citadel, but must move out of range of the Artillery. If the Artillery on
square ten is moved to square nine, then the figure of the attacking side on
square two could occupy square three, and the next move could take the Citadel;
or if the Artillery on square eight were moved to square nine, then the figure
on square two could move to square seven, and on its next move could take the
Citadel; for though the Citadel would be in range of the Artillery on square
nine, that would not prevent its capture. A city may be very well defended
on one side, and yet might be easily taken at another point.</p>

<p>Of course, the Cavalry and Infantry should co-operate with the Artillery in
defending the Citadel; and the player should endeavor to prevent the attacking
party from occupying any square from which it could be taken.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Explanation to Plate 4.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;If the Artillery on square 21 is moved to square 22, the Artillery
on square 26 can take it, or move out of range. If the Artillery on square 26
takes the Artillery moved to square 22, then it could be taken by the Cavalry
on square 20, or the Artillery on square 23. If it, on the other hand, moves to
square 27, it could be taken by the Artillery on square 23; and if it is moved
to square 24, 25, or 31, it could be taken by the figure on square 30. But if it
is not moved at all, then the Artillery moved to square 22 could take it its next
move.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Shows how the figures of the game can be moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cavalry can be moved one, two, or three squares, in any direction, at the
discretion of the player,&#8221; provided the way is not obstructed by another figure.
For instance, the Cavalry on square 15 could not be moved to square 12,
because the figure on square 13 intervenes. Nor, if the cavalry is moved to
square 37, could it afterwards be moved to square 35 or 34, while a figure occupied
square 36. If the Cavalry on square 15 is moved to square 37, it could
afterwards be moved to square 29, 21, or 12, or to 22 or 6, or to 30, 23, or 15, or
to 38, or to 45 or 53, or to 52, 65, or 76, or to 44, 51, or 57, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light Infantry moves one, two, or three squares, directly forward, right
or left obliquely, and one or two squares in any other direction, at the discretion
of the player.&#8221; Now, if a piece of Light Infantry occupies square 36, it
could be moved directly forward to square 51, 64, or 75; left obliquely to square

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> When a piece is taken it is removed from the board, and the piece by
which it is taken is placed on the square which was occupied by the captured
piece.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> Whenever a piece of Artillery of one side is placed in range of a piece of
Artillery of the other side, the first piece can be taken by the second. See
Plate 4, Figure 1.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[C]</a> The necessity of the co-operation of two or all of the different arms represented,
and in many instances their dependence on the support of each other, is
demonstrated in many real battles.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[D]</a> The Wagon is captured in the same manner as other figures are; it cannot
be taken while under cover of a piece of Artillery of its side.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[E]</a> Success sometimes rewards a bold operator, in this game as well as in
war, who, <i>ignoring all accepted theorems</i>, ventures upon a hazardous enterprise.</p>
